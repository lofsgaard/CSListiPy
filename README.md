# CSListiPy

#### Video Demo:  xxx
#### Description: Creates a spotify playlist using data from a live setlist at setlist.fm. 
#### This is my final project for Harvards CS50X

## Installation
For this project I used [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage package dependencies.

For Poetry:

Step 1:
Clone or  this repository to a local folder

Step 2:
Create a virtual environment using Poetry:


`cd to the folder where the code is located`
```
poetry shell
```
To install dependencies:
```
poetry install
```

For other virtual environment:

Create a virtual environment using your preferred software and install packag
dependencies which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Configure the environment variables

Rename the file .env-example to .env

These are the API keys and other mandatory keys we 
need to authenticate to both the setlist.fm API and the Spotify API.

- `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = xxx`
- `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = xxx`
- `SETLIST_API_KEY = xxx`


### How to get the spotify client ID and client SECRET:

Log into `https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications` with your
spotify account.

Click the green button called `CREATE AN APP`

>App name: Choose the name of your app. Can be whatever

>App description: Something descriptive

Agree to the Terms of Service

Client ID is on the left, copy that and save it to `.env`

Click `SHOW CLIENT SECRET`

Client SECRET is on the left, copy that and save it to `.env`

Now click `EDIT SETTINGS`

And add `http://127.0.0.1:8080` under `Redirect URIs`

Click add then `SAVE`

### How to get the setlist.fm API key:

Sign in or register an account on `https://www.setlist.fm`

Once signed in go here to request an API key `https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api`

After a little while you will get an API key. Paste that into `.env`
behind `SETLIST_API_KEY = `


## How to use this script

After installing the dependencies and fixing `.env` to have all necessary keys 
navigate to your folder in the terminal and run the following.

First navigate to `setlist.fm` and find a setlist you want to make into a 
spotify playlist.

You need the `setlistID` located last in the URL. It looks like this `33bc8cd5`

Next run the script:

`python main.py`

The first time this project is run, or if the API keys from spotify has expired
a web browser will open and ask you to sign in.

Once that is done it will prompt you for
- `Name of the playlist`
- `Description of the playlist`
- `setlist.fm setlistID`

Output will look like this:

```
Name of the playlist: Test Playlist
Description of the playlist: Description of a playlist
SetlistID from setlist.fm: 33bc8cd5
29-Dec-22 13:50:44 - Tracks and artist fetched from Setlist
29-Dec-22 13:50:45 - Playlist created
29-Dec-22 13:50:49 - Tracks fetched from Spotify API
29-Dec-22 13:50:49 - Tracks added from setlist to playlist!
```

Now head over to spotify and enjoy. Please make an issue or ask if something is not working.

### Some more details on how authentication to the Spotify API is done.

Authentication flow is somewhat complicated, so I decided to use an
external library called:

`spotipy`

This library handles the auth token and refresh token generated by Spotify,
and will refresh itself if needed when it runs out. This is done because we authenticate at every run,
to make sure we are logged in.

Spotipy GitHub repository: https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy

Spotipy documentation: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.0/

### Other information

As mentioned in the title, this project was created after finishing Harvards
CS50x course.

`https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/`

Highly recommended if you are as me new to the world of CS. Even if I have over 10 years
experience in the IT world, I learned a ton and all thanks to an engaging teacher 
and interesting problem sets. Some more complicated than others. This course is free.
